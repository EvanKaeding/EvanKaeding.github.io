Hey there! I'm Evan.

I'm currently building a next generation analytics stack at [Wieden + Kennedy](https://www.wk.com).

## Specialities:
- **R**: data analysis and statistical modeling
- **Python**: moving data around in prod
- **Docker**: reproducibility and fewer headaches in prod
- **BigQuery (SQL)**: storing and distributing access to large amounts of data
- **Google Data Studio**: enabling and democratizing data visualization

## Consulting:

I am available on a limited basis for consulting engagements.

- **Solution Architecture**: <!--- Building an analytics stack? I have some thoughts on that. -->
- **Vendor Selection**:<!--- I have experience with dozens of data & Martech vendors. Ask me about it. -->
- **Training**:<!--- I help great analysts productionize their analysis and work in teams. -->
- **Development**:<!--- I'll roll my sleeves up and write/look at your code. -->

## Personal

I enjoy most forms of outdoor recreation, including (but not limited to) swimming, biking, running, triathlons, surfing, backpacking and skiing (downhill, backcountry & cross country).

I live with my partner in Portland, Oregon.
